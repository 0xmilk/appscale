AppScale is a platform that allows users to deploy and host their own Google 
App Engine applications. It executes automatically over Amazon EC2 and 
Eucalyptus as well as Xen and KVM. It has been developed and is maintained 
by the RACELab at UC Santa Barbara. It supports both the Python and Java 
Google App Engine platforms.

The latest stable release is AppScale 1.4, released September 7, 2010. The
code maintained here is definitely not the stable release and should not
be considered stable in any reading of the word, but is likely to be
bleeding edge in comparison.

If you're looking for some sample applications to deploy, we include a number 
of them in the sample_apps directory in the AppScale Tools. Two more 
particularly interesting applications that work seamlessly with AppScale are:

KOALA - A web interface to Amazon EC2 and Eucalyptus
Bloog - A RESTful blog that uses the Python webapp framework. As the official 
code is a bit out of date, we recommend using Mike Dragon's patched version.

Please note: The current version of AppScale does not provide data persistence. 
If you terminate your AppScale deployment, it destroys all data accumulated 
during its execution. Persistence support is on our roadmap for release in 
the near future.

Why Develop AppScale?
Our goal with AppScale is to provide a open-source cloud platform that anyone 
can use to deploy your Google App Engines to and to perform research on cloud 
platforms. To support research in this area, AppScale provides the following 
capabilities:

Support for a number of very different databases unified under the Google 
Datastore API, allowing users to appropriately compare these new datastores.
Completely automated deployment over any number of machines - AppScale 
writes all the configuration files and starts up whatever needs to be started 
in the right order.

Placement support - if you don't like where AppScale puts web servers and 
databases, you can tell AppScale where to put them. Like before, AppScale 
still automates the configuration and deployment of all the components in the 
system.

New APIs - since AppScale is open-source, you can add your own APIs for your 
developers to use in their applications. We've already added MapReduce and 
EC2/Eucalyptus APIs, so now Google App Engine developers can spawn virtual 
machines and run distributed computation from within their applications.

Cloud deployment - want to run AppScale over a dozen machines in Amazon EC2 
or Eucalyptus? Want to run AppScale on your desktop in a virtual machine? 
The included tools support all of these options out of the box - so get 
started and see what's new in AppScale!

Speaking of using AppScale for research, here's a list of publications that 
use AppScale. If you're using AppScale in your research, drop us a line on 
the AppScale Community page and we'll include you in the list!
